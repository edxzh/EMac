# EMac
EMac is to describe for my daily-used softwares, as well as configurations and preference on MacOS, inspired by the idea: [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)

## Update OS related package
1. Update operate system to the latest version
2. brew update
3. xcode-select --install
4. sudo xcodebuild -license accept

## Terminal
[ITerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

## Shell
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

configurations in `~/.zshrc`
```
ZSH_THEME="arrow"
export EDITOR='vim'
plugins=(git ruby rails autojump docker encode64 bundler zsh-autosuggestions)

git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global fetch.prune true
git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra
```

## IDE
the built-in `vi` with OS is not the `vim` developer used to use, it only has limited functions, so `vim` must be installed mannually.
```shell
$ brew install vim --with-override-system-vi
```
### vim configuration
follow the instruction: [https://github.com/Dogzhou/vim_config](https://github.com/Dogzhou/vim_config)

### install ctags
normally the result of executing `ctags -R` will cause an issue
```shell
$ ctags -R --exclude=.git --exclude=log *
ctags: illegal option -- R
usage: ctags [-BFadtuwvx] [-f tagsfile] file ...
```

That's saying new `ctags` should be installed rather than original one.
```shell
$ brew install ctags
```
alias ctags in `~/.zshrc`
```shell
alias ctags="`brew --prefix`/bin/ctags"
```

## GIT
install
```shell
$ brew install git
```
configuration
```shell
$ git config --global user.username yourusername
$ git config --global user.email youremail
$ git config --global pull.rebase true
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
### global ignore
I've seen lots of projects' git ignore file contain OS related or IDE related files, such as `.DS_Store`, `.idea`, or logs file, however project specified ignore file should not care about it, as different developers work with different OS/IDE, git ignore file will become a monolith if every one put their personal OS/IDE ignore pattern there.
I highly recommend every developer maintains their own global git ignore file according to their preference, so `.gitignore` file inside project repository only care about project own files at framework/language level.

```
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Edit `~/.gitignore_global`

## Development Environment Setup

### asdf
Use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage multiple runtime versions.

```
$ brew install asdf
$ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
$ zsh
$ asdf plugin-add ruby https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git
$ asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
$ asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
```

add the following to `$HOME/.asdfrc`:

```
legacy_version_file = yes
```

### tig
```
$ brew install tig
```
